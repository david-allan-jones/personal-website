I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2019, and have been working as technology professional ever since. My work in the past has included troubleshooting, web development, database administration, Android development and software design.",

I can still remember playing the Nintendo Entertainment System or Sega Genesis in our small apartment when I was just a few years old. Software has brought immeasurable joy to my life, and so I hope to pay it forward. Not by developing games, but by creating products and services that make the world a better place to live."
